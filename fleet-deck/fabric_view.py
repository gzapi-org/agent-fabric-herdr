"""fabric-view: Fleet Deck's views of the fleet, in herdr plugin panes.

    fabric-view board                 the fleet tab: every placed agent, one
                                      row each; c compare, p plan, P PRs
    fabric-view agent [--agent L]     one agent; the login defaults to the
                                      herdr tab the pane was opened from
    fabric-view prs                   in-flight pull requests by owner
    fabric-view open board|agent|prs  for a plugin action: open that pane

The data is agent-fabric's tools/fabric/fleet.py, imported from the
agent-fabric checkout, never copied (agent-fabric ADR-046). A view reads on
demand: at open it draws what fleet.py's cache holds, with its time, and
fetches; it refreshes each section by its cost class while the pane has
focus (terminal focus reporting, DECSET 1004) and stops when focus leaves;
`r` refetches every section once. A fetch already running when focus
leaves runs to its end (fleet.py's sources are bounded), and starts
nothing after it.

A view only reads. It calls no herdr socket: `server.socket_access =
"outside_panes"` refuses a pane's process, and the agent view takes its
login from HERDR_PLUGIN_CONTEXT_JSON instead. `open` is the one herdr call,
and it runs as a plugin action, which herdr places outside the panes.
